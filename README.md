# List Operations in Python

This Python script demonstrates basic list manipulation operations. It's designed to help beginners understand how to work with Python lists effectively.

## Features

The script performs the following operations:

1. *Creates an empty list* called my_list.
2. *Appends* the values 10, 20, 30, and 40 to the list.
3. *Inserts* the value 15 at the second position (index 1).
4. *Extends* the list with additional values [50, 60, 70].
5. *Removes* the last element from the list.
6. *Sorts* the list in ascending order.
7. *Finds and prints* the index of the value 30.

## Output Example

```bash
Index of 30: 4
Final list: [10, 15, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60]
